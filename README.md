# Formula-1-winner-prediction
*FORMULA ONE WINNER PREDICTION * This project is aimed towards predicting the future F1 GP winners based on the driver and constructors perfomance
F1 Constructors performance are largely dependent on the FIA techinical regulation (power unit,fuel system,brake system limitations) for the season.
After the 2013 season new engine regulation were made (Hybrid era) Mercedes-Benz are most dominat team since followed bY Redbull Racing and Scuderia Ferrari.
Rules have been changed after the 2021 so whatever analysis made here will not apply for 2022 season and so far. only data after 2010 will be considered in the following analysis.
This is just an colab file, i have added another repository containing the python file having the app version.
